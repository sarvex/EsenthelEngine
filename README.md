### Getting things running
1. Download the entire repository to your computer
2. Start the "Engine Builder" tool and click "Do Selected" to run all checked tasks in order (compile the engine, link the libraries, compile the editor, etc.)
3. Enjoy!


### Engine Builder
It is important to run Engine Builder with all of the tasks that are checked by default, each time you update your engine source.

Simply start "Engine Builder" and click the "Do Selected" button at the bottom, which will execute all tasks that are currently selected.

Checked tasks will be executed in order from top to bottom, as some of the tasks depend on other tasks being executed first - those at the bottom may require that those at the top were already executed.


### Editions
Titan Engine is available in 2 Editions:
* **Binary** available from Esenthel Website - https://esenthel.com/
* **Source** available from GitHub Website - https://github.com/Esenthel/EsenthelEngine

Sometimes Source Edition is updated more frequently, which means that the Binary Edition may be older.

Everytime when the Editor is started, it checks Esenthel Website for an update to the Engine, it checks the Binary Version.

Since the version on Esenthel Website will usually be different from the one that you compile manually from the Source Code, it will display that "an Update is available".

However if your Source version is newer than the Binary version on Esenthel Website, then after clicking "Update" you will be actually updating to an older version.

                                                                                                                                                                         
### Branches
There are 2 branches: Main and Development.

Main is the one you should be using, as Development is the branch in development, which may fail to compile, contain bugs or even break your project.
Do not use Development.
